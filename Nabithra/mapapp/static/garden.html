        The Botanical Garden in Puducherry, also known as Jardin Botanique, is a beautiful and historic garden located near the New Bus Stand in the heart of the city. It was originally established in 1826 during the French colonial era and was later developed into a true botanical garden by Swiss botanist George Samuel Perrottet in 1831. The garden spans about 8 hectares and houses more than 1,500 species of plants, including many rare and exotic varieties. Divided into 30 thematic sections, it offers a rich display of global flora adapted to the local climate. The garden features well-maintained French-style landscaping, with pruned trees, gravel paths, and ornamental fountains. Visitors can enjoy attractions like a musical fountain on weekends, a toy train ride for children, and a small aquarium. It is a peaceful retreat for nature lovers and a key example of Puducherryâ€™s botanical and colonial heritage. The garden is open daily from 10 AM to 5 PM, with a nominal entry fee.

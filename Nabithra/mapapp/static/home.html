        Lawspet, my hometown in Puducherry, is a vibrant locality with a rich history and diverse community. Named after Jean Law de Lauriston, a French military commander, it has evolved from a sparsely populated area in the 1990s to one of the most densely populated regions in Puducherry. The locality is known for its educational institutions. It also houses the Puducherry Science Centre & Planetarium, a popular educational facility. Lawspet is represented in the Puducherry Legislative Assembly as Constituency No. 11, with M. Vaithianathan as the current MLA. The Lawspet Police Station ensures safety in the area, and essential services make it a well-connected locality. With its growing development, Lawspet remains a lively and important part of Puducherry.
